        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>For those of you who aren’t familiar with Jollof Rice (Jellof rice) —
            it is a rich and incredibly rich, aromatic, 
            tasty West African one-pot Meal.
            <br>It’s similar to Jambalaya but with distinctive African spices. 
            It consists mainly of cooked rice and tomato stew flavored with spices such as thyme, 
            scotch bonnet pepper, onions, and garlic.
            <br>The dish is a staple of West African cuisine, particularly that of Ghana, 
            Nigeria, Senegal, and Gambia often eaten and enjoyed during holidays, weddings, 
            birthdays, and other special events.

        <h3><u>Ingredients</u></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>Tomato</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Maggi</li>
            <li>Other seasoning</li>
        </ul>
                    
        <h3><u>Steps</u></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The inevitable foundation for building up the flavor in this meal is to start by sauteeing the Onions. 
                This should take about 3 to 5 minutes. 
                <br>The next thing is to stir in the tomato paste. This adds a deep and rich tomato flavor; 
                I simply fry this for another 5 minutes or thereabout. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add the ginger and garlic and cook along with the tomato paste for another two minutes; 
                Actually, by the time this is ready, you will notice it in the smell. 
                <br>If you keep it cooking any longer, you might risk burning them. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add the blended peppers. Usually, there is no particular time frame for frying this pepper. 
                I often stop when the sauce becomes really thick, and the oil literally floats on top of the sauce. 
                <br>At this point, most of the water is gone, and the sauce no longer smells raw. Trust me, 
                you will know, but just in case you are still in doubt, I would say maybe 15 to 20 minutes  
                depending on the quantity of water in your blended pepper.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Finally, in building my flavor, I add the thyme, curry powder, salt,
                white pepper (good but optional), and seasoning cubes. 
                Adjust the seasoning at this point if there is a need to.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Once the flavor is on point, then, I stir in the Rice. Make sure you 
                stir the rice properly until you cover each grain of rice with the sauce.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Now add the chicken stock. Give it a brief stir and cover it up with
                a tight-fitting lid. If your lid is not fitting enough, simply cover 
                the rice with foil paper before covering it with the lid. 
                <br>This is because Jollof needs a lot of steam in order to turn out well.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Once the rice comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low immediately and continue 
                to cook until the rice is done, about 20 to 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Serve with Fried Chicken, Spicy Grilled Chicken, Grilled Tilapia Fish, or Gizzards and plantains.
            </li>
        </ol>
